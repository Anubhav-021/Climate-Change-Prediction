# üåç Climate Change Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting global land temperature trends using time series analysis, specifically leveraging the SARIMA model. The work is directly aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action, which underscores the urgent need to combat climate change and its impacts.

## Key Insights

1. Rising Global Temperatures: The analysis reveals a consistent upward trend in global land temperatures, indicating ongoing global warming.
2. Seasonal Patterns: Significant seasonal variations are present in the data, effectively captured by the SARIMA model, allowing for accurate predictions.
3. Model Accuracy: The SARIMA model's predictions closely match observed data, validating its reliability in forecasting future climate trends.
4. Future Projections: The model predicts continued temperature increases, highlighting the importance of immediate and sustained climate action.
   
## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation: The dataset was cleaned to remove null values and restructured for time series analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Trends and seasonality were identified and visualized.
3. Modeling with SARIMA: A SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model was implemented to predict future temperature trends.
4. Model Validation: The model's predictions were validated against a test dataset, showing high accuracy.
   
## Results

The SARIMA model effectively predicts global temperature trends, showing a clear upward trajectory, which aligns with the broader scientific consensus on climate change.
